# Data-Science-Projects
I hold a PhD in Computational Physics from the University of Tunis El Manar. My PhD research dealt with the investigation of electronic and magnetic properties of two-dimensional materials based on Density Functional Theory combined with a realistic modeling approach. 
During my PhD, I did two internships at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan. I recently completed a bootcamp in Data Science.
